## Project Proposal 
**Due March 21, 11:59pm**

300-1000 words total across all of the sections below

### Description of Problem/Opportunity

What happens when you need feedback but you cannot reach your teacher? It is a common problem among college students who rely on their professors for guidance. While it remains crucial to connect with your teacher whenever possible, Najmah and I wanted to make a gbt that serves as professors/teachers providing feedback when needed. 

By offering immediate and personalized feedback, writing becomes more accessible and the educational experience more engaging. This gbt aims to transform educational practices by enhancing learning outcomes and reducing the workload on educators.

### Proposed Solution/Approach

This AI system assesses written assignments and delivers immediate feedback, encompassing grammar enhancements, style recommendations, and content suggestions. It aids students in enhancing their writing abilities with greater efficiency, fostering self-directed learning

### Project Outline and Timeline

Day 1-2: Define project scope, objectives, and immediate goals.
Day 3-4: Initial Research and Planning
Day 5-7: Start the design of a basic prototype 
Day 8-10: Initiate a focused development
Day 11-12: Conduct internal testing 
Day 13-14: Implement improvements

## Goals of project 
**Due March 21, 11:59pm**

Describe 1-5 goals of the project. 

### Goal 1: Improve Writing Skills and Learning Outcomes
### Goal 2: Increase Accessibility
### Goal 3: Enhance Teaching Efficiency and Effectiveness
### Goal 4: Foster critical thinking skills
### Goal 5: Promote collaboration

## Project Metrics 
**Due March 21, 11:59pm**

Compose 2-5 metrics to determine the success of the project. These should be measureable, and should translate to a letter grade for each. 

### Metric 1: Feedback Turnaround Time: The average time taken by the system to provide feedback on submitted essays.
A (Excellent): Less than 1 minute
B (Good): 1-2 minutes
C (Average): 2-5 minutes
D (Poor): More than 5 minutes

### Metric 2: User Satisfaction Rate: Percentage of users (students and educators) who report satisfaction with the system's feedback quality, usability, and overall impact on the learning experience.
A (Excellent): 90-100%
B (Good): 75-89%
C (Average): 60-74%
D (Poor): Below 60%

### Metric 3: Accuracy of Feedback: The accuracy of feedback provided by the system, measured by comparing a subset of AI-generated feedback against expert human evaluation.
A (Excellent): 95-100% accuracy
B (Good): 85-94% accuracy
C (Average): 75-84% accuracy
D (Poor): Below 75% accuracy

### Metric 4: Improvement in Writing Skills: Improvement in students' writing skills over a semester, measured by comparing pre- and post-implementation essay scores.
A (Excellent): 20% or more improvement
B (Good): 10-19% improvement
C (Average): 5-9% improvement
D (Poor): Less than 5% improvement

## Self-Evaluation
**Due April 26, 11:59pm**

300-1000 words

Address each of the goals, and assess each of the metrics. Include a statement on each on what you achieved or did not achieve, give support for your assessments.

Our primary goal was to improve writing proficiency and learning outcomes. The gbt is specifically designed to identify grammatical errors, ensure coherence, strengthen arguments, and maintain relevance within written assignments. By offering feedback, it enhances students' writing skills. Moreover, by providing an additional avenue for students to receive feedback, it enhances accessibility, catering to individualized learning needs and preferences.

Our third goal was to streamline teaching processes, particularly in instances where educators face overwhelming workloads. Teachers can alleviate the burden of providing individualized feedback during busy periods. This not only enhances teaching efficiency but also ensures that students receive timely and consistent feedback on their work. Additionally, the gbt serves as a valuable resource for educators, offering support and assistance when needed, thereby contributing to a more sustainable and manageable workload.

Furthermore, the gbt plays a significant role in fostering critical thinking skills among students. By prompting users with critical thinking questions, it encourages deeper engagement with course material and promotes analytical thinking. This not only enhances students' ability to critically evaluate information but also fosters independent thinking and problem-solving skills, essential for success in academic and professional contexts.

Moreover, the gbt serves as a gateway for collaboration among students. By facilitating discussions around critical thinking questions, it creates opportunities for peer interaction and knowledge sharing. Students can engage in meaningful discussions, exchange ideas, and provide feedback to their peers, thereby enhancing their collaborative skills and promoting a collaborative learning environment.

Concerning metrics, our feedback turnaround time was good. When a user submits a text, the turnaround time is 1-2 minutes. For this project, Najmah and I had 6 of our friends submit the essays they are writing during their final season. According to them, they believe that the gbt was effective and efficient. They saw themselves using the feature when needing feedback during late hours of the night when they cannot reach their professors. I believe that the user satisfaction rate was excellent. Additionally, the accuracy of feedback was excellent. The gbt was specific in defining the grammatical errors and incoherence. Finally, the improvement in writing skills was good. Although we were unable to test the gbt long-term, I believe that over time, the gbt will assist students in their writing skills. 

## Reflection on Learning
**Due April 26, 11:59pm**

500-1000 words

What do you take away from the project? Has this changed how you understand AI? Does and how does this affect future plans for learning, work, or otherwise?

I enjoyed working on this project with Najmah. We both have an interest in the education field and thought that this project would be a unique way to address any gaps in the field. We came about this idea when discussing the essays that we had for class, and explaining how it was difficult to reach our professors and get appointments at the Writing Studio. Therefore, Najmah and I believed that a gut that assesses essays would be useful for us and other students. 

My takeaway from this project was how AI can be revolutionary in education. When thinking about AI and education, it is mainly in the terms of how AI will be detrimental to students. Particularly, when concerning essays, many people believe that critical thinking and writing skills will decrease in students who use AI. However, get like Inspector Wiz demonstrate that AI can be a productive tool in terms of education and essays. Rather than using AI to write essays, this gpt can be used to improve essays and studentâ€™s writing skills. Furthermore, it benefits the teacher by assisting them when the student needs individualized help. It is well known that the current American education system overwhelms teachers. Therefore, Inspector Wiz can alleviate the stress many teachers and professors face.  


## What's Next?
**Due April 26, 11:59pm**

100-500 words

Do you plan on continuing the project? What will you do with what you've learning?

I do not plan on continuing the project. However, I will used what I learned with actions and schemes to help me If I need to create other gbts. I think that creating gbts are useful when needing specific help. AI is such a powerful that it can provide you with specific functions and actions.
